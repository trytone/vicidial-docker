; Asterisk Builtin mini-HTTP server
;
;
; Note about Asterisk documentation:
;   If Asterisk was installed from a tarball, then the HTML documentation should
;   be installed in the static-http/docs directory which is
;   (/var/lib/asterisk/static-http/docs) on linux by default.  If the Asterisk
;   HTTP server is enabled in this file by setting the "enabled", "bindaddr",
;   and "bindport" options, then you should be able to view the documentation
;   remotely by browsing to:
;       http://<server_ip>:<bindport>/static/docs/index.html
;
[general]
;
; The name of the server, advertised in both the Server field in HTTP
; response message headers, as well as the <address /> element in certain HTTP
; response message bodies. If not furnished here, "Asterisk/{version}" will be
; used as a default value for the Server header field and the <address />
; element. Setting this property to a blank value will result in the omission
; of the Server header field from HTTP response message headers and the
; <address /> element from HTTP response message bodies.
;
;servername=Asterisk
;
; Whether HTTP/HTTPS interface is enabled or not.  Default is no.
; This also affects manager/rawman/mxml access (see manager.conf)
;
enabled = yes
enablestatic = yes
;
; Address to bind to, both for HTTP and HTTPS. You MUST specify
; a bindaddr in order for the HTTP server to run. There is no
; default value.
;
bindaddr = 0.0.0.0
;
; Port to bind to for HTTP sessions (default is 8088)
;
bindport = 8088
;
; Prefix allows you to specify a prefix for all requests
; to the server.  The default is blank.  If uncommented
; all requests must begin with /asterisk
;
;prefix=asterisk
;
; sessionlimit specifies the maximum number of httpsessions that will be
; allowed to exist at any given time. (default: 100)
;
;sessionlimit=100
;
; session_inactivity specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for
; more data over the HTTP connection before closing it.
;
; Default: 30000
;session_inactivity=30000
;
; session_keep_alive specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for
; the next HTTP request over a persistent connection.
;
; Set to 0 to disable persistent HTTP connections.
; Default: 15000
;session_keep_alive=15000
;
; Whether Asterisk should serve static content from static-http
; Default is no.
;
;enablestatic=yes
;
; Redirect one URI to another.  This is how you would set a
; default page.
;   Syntax: redirect=<from here> <to there>
; For example, if you are using the Asterisk-gui,
; it is convenient to enable the following redirect:
;
;redirect = / /static/config/index.html
;
; HTTPS support. In addition to enabled=yes, you need to
; explicitly enable tls, define the port to use,
; and have a certificate somewhere.
tlsenable = yes  ; enable tls - default no.
tlsbindaddr = 0.0.0.0:8089  ; address and port to bind to - default is bindaddr and port 8089.
;
tlscertfile = /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/vicibox.crt
tlsprivatekey = /etc/apache2/ssl.key/vicibox.key
